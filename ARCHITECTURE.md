## Crypto Pompeii 
 
* when a player tries to set a block, that is relayed to everyone 
* hash of a chunk per ServerTick is checked every so often to see if client/server are out of sync 


* Players only load chunks that are nearby 
* Players can remove/add blocks for chunks 



* If you have a special access token, you can log into the server as a player and see other players (max of 256) 

* If you do not, you can view the state of the world but cannot see other players
