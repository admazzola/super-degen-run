** Use culled mesher for now... greedy mesh later (small bug) 

https://github.com/joshmarinacci/voxeljs-next/blob/master/examples/simple.html

Use these tile textures:

 ** add a grid with enemy NPCs, allow player to atk them [activate module]
 ** allow player to warp to different grids (using a gui)
     --warping will be a bit tricky, there will be a 5 second delay on the server ..align time

** allow client to lock on to things (right click - lock..adds to array of UUIDs for a Lock Window)

** fix skybox


** need to be able to lock onto other ships

** need to add certain grids that have enemies that you can kill for their stuff

** need to allow those dropped items to be salvaged into base metals

** need to allow players to do Production on the base metals to make ships  (takes time.. queue)



** make activating a warp gate work



** Make panels load faster w a function call..

** maybe we just use voxeljs so we can get greedy meshing
